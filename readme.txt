*    **Automatically correct all posts** Save time by having Perfect Tense automatically correct and update all selected posts with the click of a button.
*    **Assess grammar quality** Sort all posts by their 0-100 grammatical quality so you know which posts are ready to publish and which need more attention.
*    **Proofread individual posts** Visualize all mistakes in an individual post, giving you complete control over which changes are applied.
*    **Correct all future posts** Whenever you set a post to be published, Perfect Tense will automatically proofread and correct any errors.
*    **Flag future posts for review** For more control, Perfect Tense will flag posts with grammar mistakes so they can be proofread one more time before they are published.
